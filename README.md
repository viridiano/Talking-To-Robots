Okay... so you want to build your own robot anf have it discuss with you your plans for world domination. Or... hopefully, you're just a regular ~~nerd~~ person who wants your phone assistant to sound more like Hall and less like... well... some stupid robot.

Welcome to Natural Language Understanding, a subfield of Computational Linguistics/AI, devoted to "building models of natural language production and comprehension" (Allen 1988:1). As a newcomer to NLU, the first question you may have is:

####"Which paper should I start reading from?"

Here is a reading roadmap of NLU papers!

###### Note: This repository is a WIP.

### LAYING SOME GROUND (OR... BE READY TO GO AGAINST THE MAINSTREAM)

Books and papers in this section are not exclusively about NLU, but also about rethinking science paradigms and putting them in perspective (you'll soon realize the importance of perspective, by the way). This is due to the fact that NLU acknowledges the importance of curated knowledge bases and (at least some) rules - as opposed to shallow statistics - for the development of talking robots.
